# Labs Gatsby Navigation

An extensive navigation menu built with Gatsby.

## Dark Mode Feature

The app automatically detects the user's system color scheme preference and adjusts the color theme accordingly in auto mode. The user can toggle between dark and light mode manually and re-enable the auto mode.

The user's preferred color scheme settings are stored globally across all pages and in local storage for re-visiting users.

Depending on the user's system color scheme setting the favicon is changed between a dark and a light version.
